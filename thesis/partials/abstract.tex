\addchap*{Abstract}
In the context of mixed integer programming, the advances in computer technology allowed operations research experts to develop software solutions, known as MIP solvers, with the aim of automating and generalizing the solving of mixed integer programs (MIPs) by means of a branch-and-cut algorithm, extended with several heuristics to improve the performance. \par 
Among heuristics for mixed integer programming, rounding heuristics are important for finding integer feasible solutions early in the solution process, which causes the pruning and a faster exploration of the decision tree. Rounding heuristics work on the solution of the LP relaxation to produce an integer feasible solution. \par 
This thesis focuses on the study, extension, implementation and testing of the ZI-Round heuristic, originally proposed by C. Wallace ["ZI round, a MIP rounding heuristic". Journal of Heuristics, vol. 16, pp. 715-722 (2010)], with the aim of proposing an improved version of it. \par 
The thesis starts with an introduction to mixed integer programming and MIP solvers, followed by an overview of heuristics for mixed integer programming. Then, the ZI-Round heuristic is discussed in detail and its extensions are presented. Finally, the computational experiments are described and the experimental results obtained are discussed. \par 
The results show the improvement of the ZI-Round heuristic, therefore suggesting the use of the proposed version as the new default ZI-Round.
